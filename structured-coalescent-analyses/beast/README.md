# Structured coalescent analyses

These directories contain the input xml files and alignment files used for the multitype tree and mascot structured coalescent analyses. Due to identifiability issues, we are unable at this time to release metadata regarding the combination of vaccination status, Marshallese status, and age. As a result, I have gone through and replaced those variables in these xmls and alignment files with generic placeholder text like `community_status`. If we are able to get approval to release this metadata then I will re-populate those fields and upload the versions of the files with the actual metadata.
